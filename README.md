# Cardless-ATM-Service
<p>
  The Cardless ATM Transaction System is the project which helps people to access their
bank accounts in order to make cash withdrawals and transactions. Whenever the user
need to make cash transactions, they can enter their PIN number (personal
identification number) , make their choices, perform desired actions and then exit the
software.
The ATM will service one customer at a time. A customer will be required to enter ATM
personal identification number (PIN). The customer will then be able to perform one or
more transactions. In order to complete the transaction, he need to enter a second pin
called Transaction Pin. Customer will also be able to keep a check on his bank account
through the ATM.
